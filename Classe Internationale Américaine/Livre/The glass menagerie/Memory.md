-> Reinforce the idea that memory are difficult to remember
- "being an emissary from a world of reality"
- "It omits some details, other are exaggerated"
-> Stage director can put in the foreground objects they consider important
- Details exaggerated/attract viewer attention :
Ex : "photograph of father"
-> Father is an important character despite his absence -> plays a role in their lives
- "I am the narrator \[...], and also a character in it"
-> breaks the 4th wall  -> biased and not reliable
It's from memory (not 100% detailed or fully remembered) -> leads to stage direction "dimly lighter" and "unrealistic"
- Inspired from Tennessee William's life
Tom and him have several common points -> catharsis effect
-> writing a play to get rid of bad memories

"In Spain there was revolution"+"quaint period"
