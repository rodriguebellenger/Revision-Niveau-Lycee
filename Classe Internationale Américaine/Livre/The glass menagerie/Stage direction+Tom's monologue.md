Traditional stage directions : 
- way of acting/acting guidelines
- description of physical elements on stage
- tone+movement/moment of action
-> helps the actors/director to act the way the author wants it.

In The Glass Menagerie -> unusual :
- precise description of stage
- no character description
- explanation of metaphorical symbols :
e.g. "bees" = lower middle class worker = inhabitants of the building
lines 4,5,6 : a comment on the american lower class
-> impossible to show on stage

Conclusion on T.W.'s stage direction :
- Poetic and totally part of the play he wanted to write (mix of play/poetry)
- Straight-forward and help the play to assume its nature : a memory play -> partly fictionalized

As a result : 
-> no 4th wall
-> no suspension of disbelief

Confirmation through Tom's 1st cue : 

I) Illusion/Reality/Delusion
L.3) "appearance of truth"
L.3-4) "truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion"
-> Tom compares himself with a magician -> lexical field of magic
L.18) "I am a narrator \[...] character" = he is biased since he acts in the play
L.2) "opposite of stage magician"
-> tells the truth through a play <- illusion

II) Social background of the play
L.5-9) Beginning of Great Depression -> metaphor of blindness to convey the sense that people didn't want to accept it
\+ Comparison Spanish revolution/America
-> Putting things in perspective : "only" -> what's happening in the USA is nothing compared to Spain

III) Past/Memory
Tom is a magician who can "turn back time" -> memory play
\+ mention of family
\+ symbols
\= unreliable ?
