# Part 1 : Night
### Chapter 1
The setting of the story, they are caged in a gymnasium + guardians (aunts) with with electric rods + walks twice a day = almost cattle (probably past)

# Part 2 : Shopping
### Chapter 2
"They've removed anything you could tie a rope to." + "there is no glass" + "window only opens partly" + "glass is shatterproof" = cannot kill themselves, escape is utterly impossible no matter the way

"I try no to think too much. Like other things now, thought must be rationed." = total control over mind + body by the government

"braided rags" -> "This is the kind of touch they like : folk art, archaic, made by women, in their spare time \[...]. A return to traditional values." = objective of the government

Yet "I am alive, I live, I breath, I put my hand out, unfolded, into the sunlight." = truly hopeful
but also "Where I am is not a prison but a privilege, as aunt Lysa said" = influenced to be hopeful

a cook = "a Martha" = "dull green"

dialogue = no quotation mark or dash -> included in the narrator's description, yet direct speech

### Chapter 3

"Wives" = wives of high ranking men

"Angels" = soldier ?

"What does she envy me ?"+"I am a reproach to her; and a necessity" = foreshadowing
### Chapter 4

"This at least hasn't changed, the way men caress good cars." -> "this" = the government -> she knows the world before the authoritarian regime got in power?

"Eye" = kind of spy, infiltrated in the staff to look after everyone?

"she is my spy, as I am hers" (going to the grocery is only by pair of two) = denunciation and mistrust -> stops revolt

"these two men who aren't yet permitted to touch women"+"They have no outlets now except themselves, and that's a sacrilege"
"I move my hips"+"I enjoy the power"+"I hope they get hard at the sight of us and have to rub themselves" = reclaim some freedom through the powerlessness of other
The government controls everyone's sexuality -> sexuality is a weapon
-> vicious circle (everyone use everyone weakness, which stops any possibility of rebellion)
### Chapter 5 

government = "The Republic of Gilead"

"there are no children" = foreshadowing for the main problem that created this society and is still a problem

"there are no lawyers any more, and the university is closed" -> government stopped education

"Luke and I used to walk together, sometimes, along these streets." = it's confirmed, she knew the world before

"Econowives" = wives in lower class = no precise role, does every chores in the house

Past = danger and mistrust but possibility of choice : "don't open your door to a stranger"+"if anyone whistles, don't turn to look." but "my own clothes, my own soap, my own money, money I had earned myself"
Present = safety but dependent and ordered to : "no man shouts obscenities at us, speaks to us, touches us"
Opposition freedom to and freedom from ("days of anarchy" : freedom to/now : freedom from)

"These women could be undone; or not. They seemed to be able to choose" but "We were a society dying \[...] of too much choice"

enemy country = "Libertheos"

"one of them is vastly pregnant"+"she's a magic presence to us" = pregnancy is immensely celebrated in this world
+"showing us what can still be done : we too can be saved" = pregnancy is sacred
but ""show-off," a voice hisses" -> pregnancy is an object of pride, but also of envy from other ("all children are wanted now, but not by everyone" = going outside puts her in danger)

she could have had a child with Luke : "You know how kids like to play"

"They're tourists"+"It's been a long time since I've seen skirts that short on women"+"high-heeled shoes"="instrument of torture"+"their hair is exposed, in all its darkness and sexuality"+"they seem undressed" -> "It has taken so little time to change our minds, about things like this."+"To be seen is to be penetrated" = the government managed to change their whole point of view on women and freedom

### Chapter 6 

"We have learned to see the world in grasps." = forced adaptation to these harsh condition

"They haven't fiddled with the gravestones, or the church either. It's only the more recent history that offends them" = the government wants to come back to traditions, and erase the evolution that society have been through

"six more bodies hanging, by the necks" = "Men's Salvaging"
"bags" = "It makes them look like dolls" -> dehumanization
"They were Angels maker" = abortion, which is now forbidden (back to tradition+infertility)
"their crimes are retroactive" = wants to stop any possibility of rebellion+re-enabling abortion
but "most hospitals destroyed such records" (records of the Angels makers' names) = revolt when abortion was made illegal

# Part 3 : Night

### Chapter 7 

"The night is mine, my own time, to do with as I will, as long as I'm quiet" = physically powerless but mentally free
"lie" $\neq$ "lay"/active $\neq$ passive

memory with Moira = education+feminism : "We studied things like that, then."+"I just did \[a paper] on date rape"

memory with her mother = liberty+sexuality : "fire"/"their faces were happy, ecstatic almost"+"It had a pretty woman on it, with no clothes on, hanging from the ceiling, by a chain wound around her hands" = world before : more freedom but sexuality omnipresent -> bad

next memory -> the mother has been killed by the government (least likely)
......................  -> the main character's daughter has been kidnapped by the government and married by force

"You don't tell a story only to yourself. There's always someone else. Even when there is no one." -> the reader is a kind of imaginary friend to whom the main character talks

# Part 4 : Waiting room
