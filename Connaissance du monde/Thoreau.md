Section 2
1) He doesn't recognize it as his own government.
2) He makes a reference to the American Revolution. 
3) "The machine" is the government. By saying "organized", he accuse to government of doing oppression and robbery on purpose.He encourage the people to revolt against this "machine".
4) He using majority as an argument.
5) They "are more interested in commerce and agriculture than in humanity."
6) They bear the responsibility of their inaction. If I try to be objective, I agree with him, since it is obvious that everyone should fight for they're moral, but I don't agree with him in the sense, that it is impossible to oblige each and one of us to defend their opinion as strongly as him. It is a supererogatory action.
7) He thinks that voting is a game, like checkers, but with moral decision added. MLK, in comparison, consider it to be a sacred right, much more important than a game.
8) He thinks that the majority of the population doesn't care about politics, and its consequences.
9) It is a duty ??
10) They're all against the war, and yet they support it through their taxes.

Section 3
1) I don't agree with him because if wee resist and don't obey them, at least the time where they stand, it means that there would be no law whatsoever. There will always be someone who doesn't agree with on or more law and it is impossible to content everyone. We must obey the law until they are amended by the majority. The right to resist only comes when the government doesn't itself obey to the majority, and thus, become a tyranny. But again, the limit is very vague between both, and there will be people who say that the government is a tyranny and we should do a revolution. One solution would be to act the majority wants, but, firstly, it means that we ask their opinion to everyone, but not everyone as an opinion, or want to give, and if the government stops the vote, how can we know for sure the majority want this or that. It means that a minority would have to decide, while trying to guess what the majority would wand. And secondly, as seen earlier in the work, the majority isn't always right.
2) When the law asks you to be unjust to someone else.
3) It isn't a man's duty to rebel, because we are born to live our lives, not to try to make the place where were born better. There is no way provided by the government to express our discontent "its very Constitution is the evil"
4) He advises abolitionist to not wait until they have a majority and to act now.
5)
