## King's absolute power

The King could send whoever he wanted in prison, juste with a "lettre de cachet". Most of them were innocent and didn't know why they were sent in jail.

## Economic causes

The Kingdom was heavily in debt because of the expensive wars, like the American Revolution that the King supported. The King had to raise new taxes but the Third Estate were already too much taxed, and the judges (who are part of the Second Estate) refused to revise the tax system and tax the First and Second Estate.

## Taxes

The Third Estate (the commoners) worked extremely hard, but were still very poor because they had to pay most of their ressources for taxes (quitrent, tailles, etc)

## Political causes
The society is composed of three Estates :
First Estate : Clergy
Second Estate : Nobility
Third Estate : Commoners
The two first Estates represent less than 5% of the population, but own much of the land, are the richest and pay the least taxes. The Third Estate represents 95% of the population and payed 50% of their income in taxes and ad almost no politcal power.

The Estates-General :
It's a lawmaking body that the King summon. Each Estate had one vote, which is why the Third Estate felt powerless ; the First and Second Estate voted together to maintain their priviliges.

## Miscelleanous

The enlightenment ideas also played a role in the French Revoltion.
The idea of a Revolution was planted by the American Revolution.
The Bourgeois had a lot of grievances because, even tho they were rich and educated, they still had no political power
