Napoleon came back victorious from his battles in Egypt, and used his popularity to overthrow the Directoire in november 9, 1799. His coup ended the First Republic and established a Consulate.
He then appointed himself First Consul, and then, in 1802, Consul for life, thus becoming a Dictator. In december 1804, he crowned himself Emperor at Notre Dame (Coronation).

He used his powers to restructure the police, departmental, local governements and criminal court system so that he could control them. Prefect were appointed to control each department, and deputies and police comissioners were appointed by Napoleon.
There were a huge censorship and the informations were controlled, plus there were no real separation of powers.
Also, the regime favored the bourgeois who rallied Napoleon and they were blended within the old nobility.

The Napoleonic code showed Napoleon's conservative and authoritarian views : Woman's right were abolished and the old paternal power was restored. Furthermore, slavery was reestablished, even though it was abolished in 1792.
