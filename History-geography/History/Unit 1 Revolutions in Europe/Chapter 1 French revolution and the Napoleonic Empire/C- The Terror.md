The Convention decided to suspend the constitution and started ruling by means of exceptional measures (which they can do whatever they want). They created to committees to govern the country : the Committee of General Security, in charge of the police and arrested suspects, and the Committee of public safety, which led the war.

The committee of public safetu was led by Robespierre, who got rid of opponents and many deputies who where sent to the guillotine in early 1794 (300 000 suspects arrested, 17 000 officialy executed, 10 000 died in prison). On July 26, Robespierre himself was executed, which signed the end of the Terror.

On october 26 1795, a new Constitution was established and created the Directoire, an executive of five directors.
