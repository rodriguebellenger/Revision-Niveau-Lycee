By 1812, Napoleon controlled most of Europe, with the exception of Russia, Prussia and Portugal. 
He imposed reforms thoughout Europe : end of serfdom, and beginning of religious tolerance.
He imposed new leaders to the countries he had invaded, but he underestimated people's nationalism (uprising in Spain).
His dynasty collapsed in 1814, because of military defeats (Russia). HE was briefly restored in 1815 after he escaped Elba's island, but he was beaten by the European coalition at Waterloo and brought back in exile, in St Helena. He died in 1821.
