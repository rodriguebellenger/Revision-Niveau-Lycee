After Napoleon's defeat, Louis XVI's brother, who was exiled after he fled France in 1791, was allowed to come back in Paris (Bourbon Restoration). The Congress of Vienna asked him to bring a Constitution before being restored.
He's officially crowned in may 1814 and granted a royal charter, which established limited monarchy.

But some rights from the Revolution were kept : 
- Declaration of equality before the law
- Due process rights
- Religious toleration
- Freedom of the press
- Protection of private property
- Abolition of conscription (forced to serve in the army)
- And also the Napoleonic code.

Nevertheless, freedom of press was mostly restricted by harsh censorship. Political equality didn't exist as the suffrage was an selective one.
Moreover, the Concordat limited the religious toleration, as the Catholic Church was seen as the main one.
