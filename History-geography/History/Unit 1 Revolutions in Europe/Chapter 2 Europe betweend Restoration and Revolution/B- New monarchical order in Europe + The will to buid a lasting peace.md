The Congress of Vienna is a series of meeting during 8 months (1814-1815) between the governement of Europe's main power (England, Russia, Austria, Prussia, France) to create a lasting peace and order, after Napoleon's defeat.

Prince Metternich was an Austrian statesman, minister of foreign affairs between 1809 and 1848, and the leader of the Congress of Vienna.

The balance of power is a situation were every country have roughly equal power.
The European contries formed alliances/coalition to counterbalance the power of the other.
An Intrnational policy is the policy of a group of nations protecting itself against the other by matching their power to the opposite side.

Legitimacy is the fact of being allowed by law or done by law according to the rules of an organization. In this case, we call legitimacy the fact that the Congress of Vienna brought back monarchs to their throne to restore peace and order.

The Holy alliance  is a coalition created in 1815 by the monarchists of Prussia, Austria and Russia to defend themselves from the revolutionary ideas (democracy) that spread throughout Europe.

The Concert of Europe is a general agreements between the Europeans power to maintain the balance of power, political boundaries, ...
Its purpose was favoring preservation of the political and territorial status quo.

Metternich's idea was to wipe out the revolutionary ideas and return to absolutism. With that idea in mind, he wanted to weaken France to stop it from invading Europe again, while not humiliating it, to avoid revenge. In that purpose, he reinforced France's neighbour to contain it, and he gave the French throne back to the ruling family of France.

Metternich's plan had three ideas : balance of power, legitimacy and compensation. Balance of the power is the fact that no country is powerful enough to be a threat to the other. To achieve this goal, Metternich used the idea of compensation (shift of territories). Legitimacy is the idea to bring back monarchs from before Napoleon and the French Revolution, in the idea that going back as everything were before would stop revolutions.

The Congress of Vienna was considered a success because it lead to long lasting peace (40 years) between the Europe's main power. It was also a success because one of its point was to bring back absolutism which, apart from France and Britain, it achieved.

In the long term, it lead to the spread of Nationalist and Liberal ideas trhoughout Europe (Italy, Greece, Germany, Poland, ...)
