The tensions that led to the February Revolution, in particular due to the economic crisis, persisted during the first month of the Republic. It made investors and businessmen cautious about expanding their activity, which made the number of unemployment rise to 115 000 Parisians who were working in the national workshops.
Unfortunately, at on point the Assembly decided that the national workshops were too costly and closed them by Decree, on June 21, 1848. That led to  street fighting and barricades in the capital, and after a few days of fighting, the army finally subdued the revolt. It caused a break between the workers and the republicans government, which that censorship was restored and lots of political clubs were forcefully closed. 
Moreover, the peasantry, who were more conservative and afraid of the radical republican ideas, decided to vote for a right-wing assembly, exactly like the more conservative bourgeois.
